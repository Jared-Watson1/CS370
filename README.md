# Welcome to DooleyAFavor! ðŸŽ‰

Hey there, Emory students! We're super excited to introduce you to **DooleyAFavor**, our new app for getting things done around campus. Whether you're swamped with work or just looking for some extra cash, we've got you covered.

## What's DooleyAFavor All About?

Imagine this: you've got a million things to do and just not enough time. Enter DooleyAFavor. Our app lets Emory students post tasks they need help with. Other students can pick up these tasks and earn some money while helping out. It's all about connecting students with those who want to help!
